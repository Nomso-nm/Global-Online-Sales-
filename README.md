**Introduction**


In the fast-paced world of e-commerce, data-driven decision-making is the linchpin of success. This project delves into the rich dataset of "Nuestro Amazon," a simulated e-commerce environment designed to mirror the complexity and dynamism of online retail platforms. This dataset is a microcosm of an e-commerce universe, encompassing a wealth of information across eight tables that range from product categories and customer interactions to order details and supplier contributions. 


**Key Questions**

What are the top five best selling products? 

Which categories generate the most revenue?

What is the average order value? 

Which customers have the highest purchase frequency?

Are there seasonal trends in sales?

How does the sales performance vary across different regions or countries?

What is the average product price across different categories?

Which suppliers contribute the most to the product catalog?

What is the average quantity of products sold per order? 

What is the relationship between the price of products and their sales performance?

**Method of Analysis**

The analysis commenced with a thorough inspection of the "Nuestro Amazon" E-Commerce Dataset. The dataset's structure, with nine distinct yet interconnected tables, provided a substantial ground for a comprehensive analytical approach tailored to unravel key business metrics. The analysis was done by using Excel's pivot tables, a powerful    feature that allowed us to aggregate and dissect the data across multiple dimensions. This tool's versatility was instrumental in segmenting the data to reveal underlying patterns and trends.  

Also, this analysis utilized Excel's VLOOKUP function, which enabled us to cross-reference and consolidate data from various tables. This function was pivotal in pulling relevant information into a centralized worksheet, forming a cohesive dataset that facilitated a holistic analysis. The approach was iterative and exploratory, with each pivot table crafted to answer specific questions â€” from calculating the average number of units sold per order to understanding seasonal sales trends. The VLOOKUP-enhanced dataset empowered us to draw connections and compare data points that would otherwise remain siloed within separate tables.
