**Introduction**


In the fast-paced world of e-commerce, data-driven decision-making is the linchpin of success. This project delves into the rich dataset of "Nuestro Amazon," a simulated e-commerce environment designed to mirror the complexity and dynamism of online retail platforms. This dataset is a microcosm of an e-commerce universe, encompassing a wealth of information across eight tables that range from product categories and customer interactions to order details and supplier contributions. 


**Key Questions**

What are the top five best selling products? 

Which categories generate the most revenue?

What is the average order value? 

Which customers have the highest purchase frequency?

Are there any variations in sales trend? 

How does the sales performance vary across different countries?

What is the average product price across different categories?

Which suppliers contribute the most to the product catalog?

What is the average quantity of products sold per order? 

What is the relationship between the price of products and their sales performance?

**Method of Analysis**

The analysis commenced with a thorough inspection of the "Nuestro Amazon" E-Commerce Dataset. The dataset's structure, with nine distinct yet interconnected tables, provided a substantial ground for a comprehensive analytical approach tailored to unravel key business metrics. The analysis was done by using Excel's pivot tables, a powerful    feature that allowed us to aggregate and dissect the data across multiple dimensions. This tool's versatility was instrumental in segmenting the data to reveal underlying patterns and trends.  

Also, this analysis utilized Excel's VLOOKUP function, which enabled us to cross-reference and consolidate data from various tables. This function was pivotal in pulling relevant information into a centralized worksheet, forming a cohesive dataset that facilitated a holistic analysis. The approach was iterative and exploratory, with each pivot table crafted to answer specific questions — from calculating the average number of units sold per order to understanding seasonal sales trends. The VLOOKUP-enhanced dataset empowered us to draw connections and compare data points that would otherwise remain siloed within separate tables.

**Findings and Insights** 

**The top five best selling products** 

In identifying the top five selling products Excel's VLOOKUP function was used to merge crucial price data from the 'products' sheet into the 'orderdetails' sheet, this layed the  foundation for a comprehensive revenue calculation. Upon calculating the revenue for each product by multiplying the unit price by the quantity sold, a pivot table was crafted with 'productName' in the rows and the newly created 'revenue' column in the values area. This strategic arrangement allowed for a swift aggregation of the total revenue generated by each product across all orders. Sorting the pivot table in descending order of revenue illuminated the hierarchy of product performance, bringing the top revenue-generating products to the forefront. The top five best selling products by revenue are Raclette Courdavault, Tarte au sucre, Thüringer Rostbratwurst, Rodneys Marmalade and Ipoh Coffee.

The analysis points to a varied basket of products leading the revenue charts, hinting at a broad range of consumer tastes and preferences. This diversity offers multiple vectors for strategic marketing and inventory focus. The findings from the pivot table analysis provide a clear view of the high-performing products within the dataset. A business can utilize this sort of information to refine its sales strategy, perhaps by focusing on upselling, cross-selling, and optimizing stock levels for these key products. Furthermore, the insight into the product mix can inform future product development and procurement strategies, ensuring that the offerings align with proven consumer demand.


**Categories that generate the most revenue**

The endeavor to pinpoint which product categories yield the highest revenue has culminated in definitive insights, achieved through a methodical approach to data integration and analysis. By leveraging the VLOOKUP function, critical category identifiers such as 'CategoryID' and 'CategoryName' were seamlessly merged from the 'categories' sheet into the 'orderdetails' sheet, setting the stage for a detailed revenue assessment.


<img width="269" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Nomso-nm/Global-Online-Sales-/assets/150568749/d387da40-8633-4137-ba3f-0f27d7a9ca42">

The pivot table created from the enriched 'orderdetails' dataset, with 'CategoryName' in the rows and 'Revenue' in the values, has provided a quantitative breakdown of revenue by category. Upon sorting this table in descending order of revenue, we gained a clear perspective on category performance. Dairy Products emerged as the top revenue-generating category with a commanding total of $23,589.9. Confections stood out with $22,869.1 in revenue. Beverages also showed significant revenue generation, amounting to $19,617.5. Meat/Poultry had a substantial revenues of $14,154.1 while Seafood was $13,502.3. Grains/Cereals had the least revenue at $3111.8

The insights from this revenue analysis provide actionable intelligence for strategic decision-making. A business might consider amplifying focus on high-performing categories, optimizing supply chain efficiencies, and allocating marketing resources to bolster the sales of the less performing categories. The analysis affords a comprehensive view of where the revenue concentration lies within the product categories, enabling a business to tailor its strategies to harness the strengths and address the weaknesses reflected in the sales data. 


**The average order value** 

A pivot table was created to meticulously aggregate revenue across the unique orders, pinpointing the average monetary amount that customers spent per order. The data was sorted with Order ID in the rows, ensuring each transaction was distinctly accounted for, and Revenue was placed in the values area, set to calculate the average. This configuration provided a clear perspective on the overall spending behavior of customers per transaction. The calculated average order value (AOV) across all transactions was determined to be $564.61. This figure represents the mean spending amount per order when taking all sales into account over the given period. It is an essential metric that encapsulates the revenue-generating efficiency of sales operations.

**Customers with the highest purchase frequency** 

The pivot table analysis focusing on identifying customers with the highest purchase frequency reveals key insights into customer behavior and engagement with the business. By placing 'CustomerName' in the rows and aggregating the 'OrderID' count in the values area, we effectively quantify the number of purchases made by each customer. Sorting these results in descending order allows us to immediately identify the top customers who are engaging most frequently with the business through their number of orders. The top 5 products purchased by customers were, Rattlesnake Canyon Grocery, Tortuga Restaurante, QUICK-Stop, Hungry Owl All-Night Grocers and Romero y tomillo. The clustered bar char below visualises the customers purchase frequency.

**Average quantity of products sold per order**


<img width="294" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Nomso-nm/Global-Online-Sales-/assets/150568749/b8e5280a-6bb3-47d7-95e6-a9c2636bb522">

The data indicates that the average quantity of products sold per order is 21.11. This figure gives us an understanding of the typical order size from a quantitative perspective. An average order quantity of 21.11 suggests that each order, on average, comprises over 21 items. From a supply chain perspective, a higher average order quantity can affect inventory management, requiring robust stock levels to fulfill orders and possibly influencing bulk purchase discounts from suppliers. For the business, understanding the average order quantity can help in tailoring marketing strategies, setting minimum order quantities, and offering volume discounts to maintain or increase this average. Adequate stock levels must be maintained to cater to the average order size, ensuring customer demand is met without significant backorders or stockouts. The average quantity of products sold per order is a key metric that indicates the volume of products that customers are purchasing in each transaction. It has direct implications for inventory management, pricing strategies, and marketing initiatives. Understanding this metric can help a business optimize its operations and better meet customer needs.

**The relationship between the price of products and their sales performance**

To answer this question the analysis was done with a pivot table. It represented a relationship between the price of products (Row Labels) and their corresponding total revenue (Sum of Revenue). The data does not show a direct correlation where higher prices always equate to higher revenue or vice versa. Instead, there are specific price points that outperform others, indicating that pricing strategy should be nuanced and product-specific. There are high-revenue-generating price points across the spectrum, indicating a varied market with different segments willing to pay different prices. A detailed analysis of the cost structure, market demand, and competitive pricing is essential to determine the optimal pricing strategy for each product.
